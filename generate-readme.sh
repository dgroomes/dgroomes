### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is my [GitHub profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
It is mostly generated from a simple Bash script. See <https://github.com/dgroomes/dgroomes/blob/main/README-2.md> for more.
