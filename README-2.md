# README-2

This is the real README file for this repo. The `README.md` file is used as my [GitHub profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

The `README.md` can be generated with the `generate-readme.sh` script (there are some extra steps so read the comments
in the script file for instructions), but I also customize it by hand after running the generation script. The simple
auto-generation plus some hand-written customization is a good mix of automation and simplicity.  

## WishList

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Download the `repos.json` file from the "generate" script
* DONE Exclude "archived" repos from the "generate" script
* DONE Add my GitHub gists to the README. Automate this process in the "generate" script.
