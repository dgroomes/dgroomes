### Hello! 👋

This is my [GitHub "profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
It is mostly generated from a simple Bash script. For details, see the [project notes](https://github.com/dgroomes/dgroomes/blob/main/README-2.md).
